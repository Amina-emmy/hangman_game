# Hangman Game Guide
Welcome to the Hangman game! Here's a guide to help you get started:

How to Play
Two Player Setup: Sit together with a friend. One player will be the word chooser, and the other will be the guesser.

Word Chooser's Role:

Type a word into the input field.
Click the "Go" button to submit the word.
The length of the word will be displayed on the screen.
Guesser's Role:

You start with 7 attempts to guess the word.
Click on the letter buttons to guess the word.
If you guess a letter correctly, it will fill in the corresponding blank spaces in the word.
If your guess is incorrect, the remaining attempts will decrease.
Have Fun!
